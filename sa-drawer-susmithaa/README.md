# Scenario

You've been mentoring a co-worker that's been working on implementing a reporting page. His last day was yesterday and he told you that he tried to implement everything but ran out of time.

Our product manager wants to ship this feature out within a few hours, and he needs your help to finish up the PR. He sends you a link to the PR and also attaches the below product user stories

## User Stories

- As a user, I'd like to see all of the report names grouped by their categories on the side of the page.

- As a user, I don't want to see any deprecated reports as they're no longer relevant.

- As a user with a lot of reports, I'd like to search for reports by matching group names / report names.

## Problem outline

- Task 1: Find & fix bugs, identify & fix any UX concerns
- Task 2: Implement any missing features

## Run app using `yarn start`
